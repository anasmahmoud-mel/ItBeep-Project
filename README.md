#ItBeep-Task
Greetings from ITbeep :) 


Thank you for applying for the job of (. Net developer). We look
forward to scheduling an interview with your presence shortly. Meanwhile, if you
are interested in this opportunity, please complete this Challenge Test to
proceed with your application.

Challenge Test: this is to let us
know more about your hands-on capabilities in developing stand-alone
applications with the best practice.

The challenge is to create a single
landing page which contains a form with 3 Fields:  
- Name 
- Mobile 
- Email 

When the user
submits the form, a pop-up should appear to tell the user to choose one or more
of the services (the services should be taken from the
database). 
Also, another pop up should appear to tell the user to select how
much he/she is interested in the service (the interest should be taken from the
database). The user then can select a single option. 
After all, the application should
send an email to the inserted user's email address that will contain the
following fields: 
-
Name.
- Mobile.
- Selected Service.
- How much the user is interested in
the service.

Consider that :
- You are free to choose between
MVC, Web forms, .net core.
- Don't use asp.net forms
controls, only HTML tags, and javascript. 
- There's no redirection. All the
process should be on the same page (Single page application).
- For styling, use bootstrap
4.
- The attached files
are screenshots showing what we mean, please stick to the design and don't use
normal HTML tags like multi-select list using ajax and javascript create a set
of buttons and let the user select one of them and once anyone of them selected
to change the background for a darker color.
- Send us your results as project
files and database (.bak and SQL script )
- You must deliver your results
(database file & screenshots) within two days of receiving the
task.
